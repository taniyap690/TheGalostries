									We all make mistakes. If someone ever tells me about a guide to "Reaching the Flawlessness", then I'll grunt, slap
									(maybe the person or my palm on my head), and in turn make a suggestion of a book called, "Your Life is a Sham
									(I'll write one myself)." If I tell you my own story, my own life was a <em><strong> Miracle by Mistake</strong></em>. Yes, I was born prematurely due to
									the mistake of a doctor. He had prescribed a very wrong dose of medicines to my mother.
									I simply stopped breathing and moving in her belly and was forced to make an early arrival to this sprint of the world by two months.
									As one might expect, I did not burst into the trail of baby bawl as soon as my placenta was cut.
									Yeah, I remember 3 idiots as well. I was on a verge of death with my slim, blacken and frozen skin.
									But then the miracle happened when someone pressed, (maybe Dr. Heena Shah), her thumb on my forehead a little too harshly for a newborn.
									I still have a dent-like print of her thumb on the left side of my crown.
									This miracle came painfully, but the hurt is nothing compared to the fruit. <em>I lived and so does the mistake and miracle within me.</em>
									<br />
									<br />
									So far, I have done well for myself. Educated academically, learned to: practise the right ethics, eat healthy food, respect people
									and money the same, place your country before your home (at a very rudimentary stage right now); show humility, bolster truth,
									respect and treasure sacrifices, value democracy above adulations, and above all, I developed the courage to accept myself as I am.
									With all my glories and all my flaws. Just like the song, <b><a href = "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=450p7goxZqg">All of Me</a></b>, by John Legend. The only difference, I am both, John and Chrissy.
									Acceptance is the key to happiness. One has to accept a defeat to plan the new victory, let the lost one go to welcome the new one, forget yesterday
									to make a better tomorrow. Holding on is a good thing, but then one has to cut off the infected leg to save the whole body.
									<strong>Persistence and Intransigence</strong> are two very <em>different</em> things.
									<br />
									<br />
									I myself have made a ton of miserable mistakes that will never be erased. Which? Well, the very first,
									I valued education quite late. I was a dull and mischievous child. Made my mother cry during exams as I had no notes to read when I was
									in the sixth grade. I studied hard in college, but the loops will always be there to slow me down. I have to frequently check my grammar,
									go back to the math of high school, and see the physics of light again and again (even when I read <b><a href = "https://danbrown.com/#author-section">Dan Brown</a></b> ).
									My other mistake, I have made several unjustified expenses, be it clothes, books, stationaries, electronic gadgets or even gold,
									Yes, I have lost a gold earring that belonged to my grandmother. I did waste my family's hard-earned money a lot.
									Now, losing such wealth for a middle-class family is not a tickle at the back. My father hadn't eaten for two days.
									Again, if I expand my list, then I had lost my bicycle owning to my carelessness. Fought with my people, said the harsh words I'll
									never be able to take back. <em>Lost friends and lost my happy days.</em>
									<br />
									<br />
									But this is not unique to me. Though I haven't seen even a minuscule percent of the world, I know this happens with everyone.
									We all do lose our smiles one day, but then also find our cackles back after the tear storms.
									In the torrid dark times, we not only cry but also learn. With every wrongdoing,
									I learned how not to do it again the wrong way. I learned a lesson of cautiousness, punctuality, tolerance and possible austerity.
									Nobody is born-white-milk of soul. We all are humans and as Dan Reynolds has rightfully put it,
									<blockquote>
										"No matter what we breed, we still are made of Greed".
										<br />
										<a href = "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mWRsgZuwf_8">- Imagine Dragon, Demons</a>

									</blockquote>
									<br />
									We all have jealousy, ego, apathy, arrogance, hypocrisy, cruelty, ignorance, and the list goes long.
									But it is also us, the very <strong><u>Humans</u></strong>, that defines and personifies devotion, altruism, kindness, magnanimity,
									patriotism, compassion, bravery, genuine creativity and this list goes infinitely further.
									Surprisingly, these are not two opposite kind of personalities. One single individual has all this residing in his existence.
									We have college-failed scientists, with billionaires convicted for money laundering. We have all colours in one universe, one soul.
									We all come with an empty void, and it's on us whether to add more bright stars or devastating meteors.
									Sometimes we do fill it with meteors or feed the wrong wolf, but then it's our responsibility and sensibility to make the rectifications.
									We rectify by atoning for our sins and redeeming ourselves from the regrets.
									<br />
									<br />
									Here, I just want to say that mistake is not a mistake. It is the intricate part of the cosmos.
									Gods make mistakes when he, though unintentionally, gives a reason for terrorism. Though this is how Rick puts it up in the defence,
									<br />
									<br />
									<blockquote>
										<q>"Percy, lesser beings do many horrible things in the name of the gods. That does not mean we gods approve. The way our sons and daughters act in our names…well,
											it usually says more about them than it does about us..."</q><br />
											<a href ="https://rickriordan.com/book/the-battle-of-the-labyrinth/" >- The Battle of the Labyrinth by Rick Riordan, 2008.</a>
									</blockquote>
									So maybe, eventhough we do bad, it's not our true intentions. It is just our subconscious mind or inherent <i>humanity</i>.
									But in our, the lesser beings, defence, we can't blame it on our sons and daughters like gods, but take the responsibility and make
									the amendments. <em><strong>After all, it's only the incorrect that makes us correct.</strong></em>
