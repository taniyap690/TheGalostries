									We all make mistakes. If someone would ever tell me about a guide to Reaching the Flawlessness, then I'll grunt,
									slap (maybe the person or my palm on my head), and in turn make a suggestion of a book called,
									"Your Life is a Sham (I'll write one myself)." If I tell you my own story, my own life was a <strong><em>Miracle by Mistake.</em></strong>
									Yes, I was born prematurely due to the mistake of a doctor. He had prescribed a very wrong dose of medicines to my mother.
									I simply stopped breathing and moving in her belly and was forced to make an early arrival to this sprint of the world by two months.
									As one might expect, I did not burst into the trail of baby bawl as soon as my placenta was cut. Yeah, I remember 3 idiots as well.
									I was on a verge of death with my slim, blacken and frozen skin. But then the miracle happened when someone pressed, (maybe Dr. Jaina Shah),
									her thumb on my forehead a little too harshly for a newborn. I still have a dent-like print of her thumb on the left side of my crown.
									This miracle came painfully, but the hurt is nothing compared to the fruit. I lived and so does the mistake and miracle within me.
									<br />
									So far, I have done good for myself. Educated myself academically, learned to practise the right ethics, eat healthy food, respect people and money the same,
									place your country before your home (at a very rudimentary stage right now), have humility, bolstered truth, respect and treasure sacrifices, value
									democracy above adulations, and above all, developed a courage to accept myself as I am. With all my glories and all my flaws. Just like the song All of Me, by John Legend. The only difference,
									I am both, John and Chrissy. Acceptance is the key to happiness. One has to accept a defeat to plan the new victory, let the lost one go to welcome the new one,
									forget the yesterday to make a better tomorrow. Holding on is a good thing, but then one has to cutt of the infected leg to save the whole body. Persistence and
									intransigence are two very different things.
									<br />
									I myself have made a ton of miserable mistakes that will never be erased. Which? Well, the very first, I valued education quite late.
									I was a dull and mischevious child. Made my mother cry during exams as I had no notes to read when I was in the sixth grade. I studied hard in college, but the loops will always be there to slow me down.
									My other mistake, I have made several unjustified expenses, be it clothes,
									books, stationaries,electronic gadgets or even gold, I wasted my family's hard earned money a lot. Yes, I have lost a gold earring that belonged to my grandmother.
									Now, lossing suvh wealth for a middle class family is not a tickle at the back.My father won't eat for two days. Again,
									if I expand my list, then I had lost my bicycle owning to my carelessness. Fought with my people, said the harsh words I'll never be able to take back.
									Lost friends and lost my happy days.
									<br />
									But this is not unique to me. Though I haven't seen even a miniscule percent of the world, I know this happens with everyone.
									We all do lose our smiles one day, but then also find our cackles back after the tear storms. In the torrid dark times, we not only cry but we also learn.
									With every wrong doing, I learned how not to do it again the wrong way. I learned a lesson of cautiousness, punctuality, tolerance and possible austerity. Nobody is born white
									milk of soul. We all are humans and as Dan Reynolds of Imagine Dragons has said <em>"No matter what we breed, We still are made of Greed"</em>. We all have
									jealousy, ego, apathy, arrogance, hypocriscy, cruelty, ignorance, and the list goes long.  But it is also us, humans, that defines and personifies devotion, altruism, kindness,
									magnanimity, patriotism, compassion, bravity, genuine creativity and this list goes more far. And these are no two different entities, they are same. We have college failed scientists, with billionaires convicted for money laundering.
									We have all colors in one universe, our own soul. We all come with empty void, and its on us whether to add more bright stars or devastating meteros. Sometime we fill it with meteors, but them it's our responsiblity and sensibility
									to make rectifications. We rectify by atoning and redeeming ourselves from the regrets. After all its only the incorrects that makes us correct.

									“Men acquire a particular quality by constantly acting in a particular way.”—Aristotle


									<br />
									One fine day, I dared up to ask her these questions. She didn't answer then, but it was after a week that I realised that even she didn't have one.
									Such is the creation of mother. Such is the creation by God.
									<br />
									From the day a small bundle of blankets with a galaxy of hopeful innocent eyes falls on a woman's womb, she does no more belong to this world.
									Her life renders to a planet, where her child is her sun. Maybe that's why the Earth is a Mother and the Sun also sounds like a Son. Yeah, it just dawned on me!
									All my life, I have seen not only mine, but every grown woman became a mother, a caretaker, a home to her child, to her pet, to her nation. Yes, that is innate in them.
									Just hand over a doll to a five year old girl, and she will comb the hair, brush her teeth, and make her go to sleep. Do the same for a boy. Bless me, if you get to see the toy in one piece!
									That's how motherhood harvests. God has unmistakenly placed a seed of selfless fostering. That seed starts growing the second she lets out her cry in the world.
								  The seed parts and the stem escaped upwards, wide opening the leaves and freely flowing the tendrils, when she gets her first barbie. The stems hardens to a trunk when she sees the foster cares and how well they really care.
								  The exponentially deeping routes finds their way to the deepest and solemnset part of her heart, and covers it in its entirety. The tree gives fruits and fragrant flowers, when she finds a child of her own. </p>
									<br />
									This is how a mother is born and made. The birth is gifted, but the growth needs its own set of catalysts. And maybe that's why, I, who still hangs on to her own mother for even a bath towel and a silly cup of coffee, has not yet found an
									ounce of altruism in me. I have not yet met my cataysts. Moreover, my confusion and partial aversion for kids doesn't help either.
									<br />
									But hey, I am a best daughter. And no, its not self-proclaimed. My own mother told me so! But again, she sees the best in everyone.
